The Adjusted Winner method (AW) is frequently used to fairly divide goods between two agents. In some of its runs, goods may be split or transferred between the agents, a phenomenon that may lead to conflicts between the participating agents. To address this issue, we aim to identify situations in which such conflicts do not arise; specifically, we describe an approach to avoid these conflicts -- consisting of the removal of a minimum number of goods as a preprocessing phase. We thoroughly examine the computational complexity of the corresponding combinatorial problem and show that, while the problem is generally intractable, there are several ways to cope with its computational hardness. We complement our theoretical analysis with computer-based simulations.
